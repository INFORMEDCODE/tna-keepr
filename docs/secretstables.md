# Secrets Tables

-   For now we make a table for each one (fav, old, all)
-   For now they are static on page

## TODO:

-   Make tables/containers moveable on the page; maybe you want to have ALL first instead of favs
-   Have a single SecretsTable component? and pass in the data that is being displayed in each one
