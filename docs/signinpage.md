# signin

1. have a main div that contains the background image and maybe things like a header
2. have a div that contains the "splitting" colour
3. have a div that contains the form

```tsx
<div className={styles.container}>
    <div className={styles.splitter}></div>
    <div className={styles.formContainer}>
        <div className={styles.loginCard}></div>
    </div>
</div>
```

## TODO:

~~- separate the form component from the card component to the image block doesn't have to be duplicated~~

-   maybe add react-icons (font awesome) the provider buttons
